What do i even put here? I guess i can say what languages i learned first then my first mods? actually let me tell you about myself first.

Im a middle schooler who is in math and science honors and is the worlds worst programmer maybe worst than yandere dev but that takes some bad programming... I mod games like scrap mechanic (ive picked up some lua doing that ğŸ¤®) and BeatSaber mostly on Oculus quest (where ive learned 99% of the c++ i know) and sometimes on pc (where i picked up a bit of c# but most of it was messing around in unity)

## Where did i get my name??

well when i used to play on psvr i wanted to make maps so i downloaded medicore mapper on my abd laptop and realized why i shouldnt be a mapper hence *future* mapper my dud(e).

## What were my first languages

erm uhhhhhhh? 

i would say i started c# then in the first month started doing quest beatsaber modding where i learned c++ but i actually am not sure?

but as a rough guessing list id say
 - c#
 - c++
 - javascript (not much just messing with bots)
 - throw in some python maybe (also just messing with bots)
 - lua ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®
