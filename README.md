What do i even put here? I guess i can say what languages i learned first then my first mods? actually let me tell you about myself first.

Im a middle schooler who is in math and science honors and is the worlds worst programmer maybe worst than yandere dev but that takes some bad programming... I mod games like scrap mechanic (ive picked up some lua doing that ğŸ¤®) and BeatSaber mostly on Oculus quest (where ive learned 99% of the c++ I know) and sometimes on pc (where ia picked up a bit of c# but most of it was messing around in unity)

## Where did i get my name??

well when I used to play on psvr I wanted to make maps so I downloaded medicore mapper on my bad laptop and realized why I shouldnt be a mapper hence *future* mapper my dud(e).

## What were my first languages

erm uhhhhhhh? 

I would say I started c# then in the first month started doing quest beatsaber modding where I learned c++ but Im actually not sure?

but as a rough guessing list id say
 - c#
 - c++
 - javascript (not much just messing with bots)
 - throw in some python maybe (also just messing with bots)
 - lua ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®ğŸ¤®
